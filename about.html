            While conducting my research I learnt that people argue about who
            represents Pharoah in the bible, because he was never named. Meaning
            that there is a high possibility that Ramses is not presented in the
            bible. When the generations were throned, they were called Pharaohs,
            they were never called by their names. The only Rameses we are aware
            of in the bible was the land or city in Egypt. In the bible we learn
            about two generations of Pharaohs, the father and the son. It is a
            beautiful story yet a tragic one, the first generation (first
            Pharaoh) feared that the Israelites might take over Egypt if they
            populate, therefore he made an unpredictable move and demanded that
            the first-born sons of the Israelites that were below the age of
            three to be killed. This way he was able to instill fear in the
            Israelites and made it easy for him to enslave them and have control
            over them
